## ðŸ“– About the Project

Welcome to the **Snowballr** repository! This page will give you an overview over the project.

This project is designed to support collaborative management of scientific papers within research groups.

Users can create dedicated **projects** and invite other collaborators to participate. Each project follows a structured paper selection process based on the [snowballing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_sampling) methodology, which helps identify relevant literature through citation networks.

Papers within a project are processed through multiple **review stages**. In each stage:

- New papers are discovered and added.
- Multiple reviewers assess each paper independently.
- Papers are **accepted** or **declined** based on consensus.
- Accepted papers proceed to the next stage.

This iterative process continues until a final, curated set of papers is selected that satisfies the project's research criteria.
ÃŸ
The platform ensures transparency, collaboration, and efficiency in literature selection â€” making it especially suitable for systematic reviews, thesis preparation, and research group coordination.

**Snowballr** consists of a couple of different repositories. This repository manages the general project documentation 
as well as the deployment process. The other repositories are the following:
- **[snowballr-frontend](https://github.com/SE-UUlm/snowballr-frontend)**
- **[snowballr-backend](https://github.com/SE-UUlm/snowballr-backend)**
- **[snowballr-api](https://github.com/SE-UUlm/snowballr-api)**
